## 1.1-1

> Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

- Sorting: browse the price of the restaurants with ascending prices on NTU street.
- Convex hull: computing the diameter of set of points.

## 1.1-2

> Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

Memory efficiency and coding efficiency, power consumption, cpu Usage.

## 1.1-3

> Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

Linked-list:

- Strengths: insertion and deletion.
- Limitations: random access.

## 1.1-4

> How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

- Similar: finding path with shortest distance. Both require are solved using graph theory.
- Different: traveling-salesman requires minimizing path such that we visit each and every node once while in shortest path we need to minimize distance between any two specific nodes.

## 1.1-5

> Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.

- Best: find the GCD of two positive integer numbers.
- Approximately: find the solution of differential equations.(food delivery -> shortest path)
